# In the context of React and modern web development, CreatePortal typically refers to the ReactDOM.createPortal function. This function allows you to render a component or element outside of its parent component's DOM hierarchy, essentially creating a "portal" to another part of the DOM.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what it means:

Portals in React: Portals provide a way to render children into a different part of the DOM tree that is outside of the parent component's DOM hierarchy.

Usage: ReactDOM.createPortal(child, container) takes two arguments:

child: The React element you want to render.
container: The DOM node to which you want to render the child.
Example: If you have a modal component that you want to render at the end of the <body> element rather than inside a specific container, you could use a portal like this:
